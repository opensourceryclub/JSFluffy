1. Either integrate JSFuck translator from online or simply translate the JSFuck
    during execution, allowing JSFuck attacks from inputted JS code. The github
    repository I found seems to have a Whatever-The-Fuck License, so there.

2. Determine language (I vote Cython, but we'll go with whatever ideas come up).

3. Create Skeleton (Work underway)

4. Fully implement Skeleton

5. Implement GUI

6. Potentially make into executable (hence wanting to use Cython)
